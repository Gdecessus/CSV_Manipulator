#              Manipulation of CSV

When tasked with manipulating a 30k + entries CSV based off a input or partial input in another column, the creation of this script was a must.
Saved me hundreds of hours in my internship at Dublin City Council ICT department 


#  How it works

The Script takes in 3 variables;
target1 - this is the field you want to change, where you expect to make a change.
target - is the paremeter you'll look for in order to make changes
newTarge - this is your outcome, it is what you want to change target1 to this value
